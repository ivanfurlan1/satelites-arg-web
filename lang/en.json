  "aboutTitle": "About Us",
  "aboutP1": "This page was born from a personal passion for astronomy, satellites, and everything related to the sky. I have always enjoyed following various phenomena closely: from satellite passes to shooting stars or fireballs, even tracking one hoping to see it fall. More than once, I invited friends and acquaintances to go out to the yard at a specific time and look up, without telling them what they were going to see. Then came the surprised messages when they discovered something they did not expect, like the passage of Starlink satellites.",
  "aboutP2": "From these experiences came the idea of sharing what I am passionate about. First, I did it on social media, announcing phenomena or events visible from Argentina, and over time, a very active community was formed.",
  "aboutH3_1": "Our Mission",
  "aboutP3": "Along the way, I noticed a difficulty: there was no tool that was truly clear, intuitive, and complete for tracking satellites. Some pages were complicated, others offered very partial information, and none brought together everything I needed. That is why I decided to create this page. At first, it was a personal project, designed to simplify my experience. Over time, I understood that what was useful to me could also be useful to many more people looking for something similar.",
  "aboutP4": "Today, this platform is designed for anyone interested in the sky: from those taking their first steps to the most advanced amateurs. The goal is to offer a simple, practical, and pleasant tool to use, with the essential information but without being overwhelming.",
  "aboutP5": "Our commitment is to continue improving and adding features, so that more and more people can enjoy the experience of observing and tracking in an accessible and attractive way.",
  "guideTitle": "User Guide",
  "guideP1": "Welcome to the SatélitesArg guide! Here we explain the main functions so you can start exploring the sky like an expert.",
  "guideH3_1": "1. First Steps: Set Your Location",
  "guideP2": "To get accurate predictions, the first thing is to set your location. You can do this in two ways:",
  "guideLi1": "<strong>On the map:</strong> Inside the map, use the search bar at the top to type the name of your city.",
  "guideLi2": "<strong>In \"Best Passes\":</strong> This section also has its own location search bar.",
  "guideP3": "Once the application finds your city, it will save it for future visits. This is crucial for calculating when a satellite will be visible from your position.",
  "guideH3_2": "2. Tracking a Satellite",
  "guideP4": "There are several ways to select a satellite to track:",
  "guideLi3": "<strong>Popular Satellites:</strong> From the \"Satellites\" menu, you can choose iconic objects like the ISS or the Hubble Telescope.",
  "guideLi4": "<strong>My Satellites (Favorites):</strong> You can save your favorite satellites for quick access. You can also add custom satellites by pasting their <code>TLE</code> data, which you can find on sites like <a href=\"https://celestrak.org/\" target=\"_blank\">CelesTrak</a>.",
  "guideLi5": "<strong>Latest Starlinks:</strong> A dedicated section to follow the most recent launches of the Starlink constellation.",
  "guideP5": "Once selected, click \"Open Map\" to see it in real-time.",
  "guideH3_3": "3. Predicting Visible Passes",
  "guideP6": "A \"visible pass\" occurs when a satellite crosses the sky above you, and at the same time, it is illuminated by the Sun while it is dark at your location (usually at dawn or dusk). To predict these events:",
  "guideLi6": "Select a satellite and open it on the map.",
  "guideLi7": "Make sure you have your location set.",
  "guideLi8": "Open the top control panel and click the <strong data-lang-key=\"predictButton\">\"Predict\"</strong> button.",
  "predictButton": "Predict",
  "guideLi9": "You will see a list of the next visible passes, with their time and maximum elevation (the higher the number in degrees, the better the view).",
  "guideH3_4": "4. Using the Radar and Pointing Compass",
  "guideP7": "This is one of the most powerful tools. When a satellite is passing, it helps you find it in the sky.",
  "guideLi10": "On the map, with a satellite selected, click the compass icon <i class=\"fa-solid fa-compass\"></i> in the bottom right corner.",
  "guideLi11": "A menu with a radar will open. Grant orientation permissions if your browser requests them.",
  "guideLi12": "The radar will show you the satellite's trajectory across the sky (the curved line) and its current position (the satellite icon).",
  "guideLi13": "Point your phone towards the sky. The pointer in the center of the radar indicates where you are looking. Match the pointer with the satellite icon to find it!",
  "guideH3_5": "5. Time Travel",
  "guideP8": "The time control panel allows you to simulate the movement of satellites in the past or future.",
  "guideLi14": "Click on the time (e.g., \"14:32:10\") at the bottom center to open the panel.",
  "guideLi15": "You can drag the timeline, change the date and time, or use the fast-forward and rewind buttons to move through time.",
  "guideLi16": "To return to real-time, simply click the <strong data-lang-key=\"realTimeButton\">\"REAL TIME\"</strong> button.",
  "realTimeButton": { "text": "REAL TIME" },

  "legalP2": "The privacy of our users is fundamental. Below, we detail what information we handle and how we use it.",
  "legalLi1": "<strong>Location Information:</strong> To calculate satellite passes, the application needs to know your geographical location. This information is obtained only when you manually enter it in the search field. The data (latitude, longitude, and city name) is saved exclusively in your browser's local storage (LocalStorage) for your convenience. <strong>It is never transmitted or stored on our servers.</strong>",
  "legalLi2": "<strong>Custom Satellites (TLE Data):</strong> If you add custom satellites, the TLE data you enter is also saved in your browser's local storage. This information remains on your device.",
  "legalLi3": "<strong>Cookies and Local Storage:</strong> We use the browser's local storage to save your preferences (location, favorite satellites, last used map layer) and improve your experience. Third-party cookies are also used for services such as advertising, as detailed below.",
  "legalLiNotifications": "<strong>Notifications:</strong> If you grant explicit permission, the application can schedule local notifications in your browser to alert you about upcoming satellite passes. This functionality is managed entirely on your device and does not transmit any personal information to our servers. You can manage or revoke this permission at any time in your browser settings.",

  "legalLi7": "<strong>Geocoding and Time Zone:</strong> For city searches and obtaining the corresponding time zone, the services of Nominatim (OpenStreetMap) and TimeAPI.io are used.
